Wizard Tower Defense Game
-------------------------
3 different gameplay experiences
Main game: Tower defense. 1 wizard tower where the player is (base). The player then spawns magical runes (towers) to defend. 
Inside Tower: Special casting of ulitimate spells, manange research and upgrades. 
Adventure: Obtain new tomes (research), recruite character NPCs (upgrades), and experience storyline

Quirks: Able to cast special spells inside of tower for ultimate abilities. Placement of certain runes on the map make ultimate abilities possible and lets the player choose where they should be casted. Casting an ultimate requires to switch to inside tower view to do what is required to cast, which is a draw back from casting such powerful magic but the epicness will be worth stepping away from the main battle breifly. Casting is a timed squence of buttons. Adventure mode to obtain more tomes (research) with a more classic RPG feel. Adventures are semi random, the more research and tomes found the more story is uncovered. NPCs can be found and recruited to man other towers (for upgrades) and help manage the main tower or make heroic acts on the battlefield as boons. Later in the enemies can enter the tower (rogues etc) and must be defeated inside or have traps rigged. Ability to shape the map during battle with spells.

Story: What enemy is attacking and why. Who is really behind the attacks. Story of seperate adventures. Interlocking of storylines. Quests for more research & upgrades. Find and train an apprientance to simulate co-op gameplay.

Multiple (4?) different types of wizards to choose from: Wizard, Mage, Warlock, Sorcerer. Each with a different style of magic.

Co-op & Single Player

Co-op: Different types of Wizards pair magic for extra spells and can combine runes for different effects. 2 wizards together can create different rare ultimate spells. Adds fun to adventure mode. Obviously harder to the point where teamwork is required
Teamwork: may entail obtaining teleportation to eachothers base tower to help cast special spells when overwhelmed. combining runes in a such a way that it migigates the added difficultily. Share knowledge (research & upgrades) for that round depending on strengths and what is expected as the wave.
